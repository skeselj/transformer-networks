    "\n",
    "There are a few patchy fields above, specificaly the 6th and 7th ones. These samples seem to have a frame and target that are similar. This means the correct vector field is close to the identity (all 0). I think the patchiness arises because when the vectors are small, they can alter their direction without greatly influencing the value they sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be nice if the field were smooth even when its elements are small in magnitude. Two next steps which I think could accomplish this are: (1) make smoothness penalty angle-based not just first-order difference based (2) train with a composite dataset of not just cracks. Note: a natural action would be to increase the smoothness coefficient, but so far I have not been able to help smoothness much without overpowering MSE."
